          I'm an ML engineer at <a href="https://unsloth.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unsloth</a> working on <a href="https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open source software</a> for LLM training and fine-tuning. My focus is on memory / speed optimizations and distributed training.
        </p>

        <p>
          I was formerly an ML engineer at <a href="https://axolotl.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Axolotl AI</a>, implementing various memory and speed optimizations for language model training, scaling it to multi-GPU / multi-node workloads, and generally improving the reliability / usability of our <a href="https://github.com/axolotl-ai-cloud/axolotl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open source software</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Before that, I was at AWS as an ML engineer, where I built <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/the-halo-trust-is-working-with-aws-to-clear-mines-faster-and-save-lives-in-the-worlds-conflict-zones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">object detection for landmines</a>, stood up a few LLM + RAG apps, and did various other applied ML activities.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Even earlier, I was at Sensor Tower modeling active users and retention curves for mobile apps, and at Fomoro AI as a Machine Learning Engineer developing RL models for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combine_harvester" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combine harvester</a> control.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I studied computer science and math at <a href="http://www.umass.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UMass Amherst</a>. Originally, I was interested in pure math / theory of computation and did some independent study of circuit complexity theory. Later, I became fascinated with computational neuroscience and its overlap with artificial intelligence. During my master's degree, I published some papers at the intersection of ML and comp neuro, focusing on spiking neural networks (SNNs), and built <a href="https://github.com/bindsnet/bindsnet"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BindsNET</a>.

          I have an Erdős number of 2 (path: Paul Erdős → Miklós Ruszinkó → me).

          I live in rural Massachusetts with my six sheep, four chickens, and a mini australian shepherd :)
